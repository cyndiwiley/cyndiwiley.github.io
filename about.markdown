# Hi I'm Cyndi Wiley, PhD

Innovation and Tech Strategist, Professor, XR, User Experience, DEI Advocate, Industry 4.0 Futurist, Accessible Tech, Art Theorist, Game Design, #A11y

I'm the Digital Accessibility Lead for Iowa State University and Assistant Teaching Professor in Graphic Design and Affiliate Faculty in Human Computer Interaction. I began my career in the late '90s in St. Louis, Missouri, working as a graphic designer and creative director, running a business, and developing a deep love of cats. I have experience teaching face-to-face and fully online courses in interactive media, game design, and graphic design. My research areas are UX/UI, game design, serious games, intersectionality of art and technology, and accessibility. 

Research:
My research interests relate to the intersection of art with STEM-based curriculum emphasizing creativity and creative thinking. Creative thinking drives innovation by moving away from status quo methods to avant garde methodology. This is achieved from combining seemingly unrelated sources and theories. It can seem bizarre at first, yet by incorporating theories from art, human computer interaction, feminist/womanist education, and play from an anthropological and sociological base, students and faculty alike become mutually engaged. Underlying all of my research is inclusion, with focus on Digital Accessibility, LGBTQ+ issues, racial equity, anti-racist pedagogy, and social justice. My work has been published in the book "Guide to Digital Accessibility: Policies, Practices, and Professional Development" edited by Rae Mancilla and Barbara A. Frey, "Creative Quarterly: Journal of Art and Design" and "100 Best Annual 2019" and presented at several international conferences.
